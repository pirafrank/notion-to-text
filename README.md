# notion-to-text

A simple way to get content of notion.site pages in plain text (e.g. for use with `curl`, etc.).

It runs:

- in standalone, to be executed as CLI program or as server.
- as lambda function (AWS)

For futher details, please check the readme files in `standalone` and `lambda` dirs.

## Why

Notion is a great note-taking tool and with sites an easy way to maintain a public page. Unfortunately being a PWA you can't get page content just by using curl, so that's where notion-to-text can help.

I've created it for personal use and as such it is provided as-is with no warranties.
